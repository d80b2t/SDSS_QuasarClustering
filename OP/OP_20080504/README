These files *20080504* were a first attempt to get the 2PCF using 
a nice and uniformly distributed random catalouge: 

randoms_npr_PRIMARY_20080502.dat

and DR5QSO_pri_data_20080502.dat 
cutting at 0.30<z<2.2. 

However, the mrdfits command when converting the ra,dec random file from:
/Volumes/Bulk/npr/cos_pc19a_npr/data/Quasars/CAS/mask/ra_dec_eta_lambda_randoms_20080502
did something weird on reading in the file (unit numbers etc.) so the outcome was disappointly simlar to OP_20080427. 

The OP files N_20080506 essentially had the same problem, as I started those running
on randoms_npr_PRIMARY_20080502.dat before I'd found the mrdfits issue. 

However, this was (begun to get)  rectified in *20080507*.
