OP_20080510 has files using `uniform' randoms from 

open(1,file='../data/DR5QSO_pri_data_20080508.dat')
open(2,file='../randoms/randoms_npr_PRIMARY_20080508.dat')


20080510.dat is the full, 44,348 (or is it 44,345??!) data strong sample. 
N_20080511* has the NCG, 38,684 (even though it was only created on the 20080516...)
S_20080511* has the SCG, 5661


Also in this directory are the results taken up Dan VBs suggestion of only looking at 
data in single plates (in case there were any issues with e.g. getting objects on
a second pass within an overlap region). 

These results are given the obvious names of: SinglePlate and MultiplePlate respectively.
(They use the same data/randoms as above, just filtered with Single_Plate_filter.pro
in the ../data/Quasars/CAS/mask/ directory).
