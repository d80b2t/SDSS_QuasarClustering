These O/P files were from the SDSS DR5 Quasar correlation function `run' I left going
while I went to Australia/LBNL. 

q_omega_rs_v1_25.pro
was used but crashed just before the final write-outs, using the finer-binned, 2D 
xi(sigma,pi) calculations. 

However, all the pair counting was done and so 
xi(s),         using kde_output_temp_20071102.dat, 
wp(sigma) using Kde_wp_sigma_output_temp_20071102.dat, 
and 
xi(sigma,pi) using kde_2d_output_tempf_20071102.dat
should all be fine.
