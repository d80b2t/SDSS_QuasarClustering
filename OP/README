Okay, so there are differences between the files in the above directories. 
The original, older files over each redshift-range, had the line: 
    if (N_rnd .ge. N_rnd_total) istat =1 
"on" in the FORTRAN code, essentially limiting the random file input read to x20 the 
datas. Whereas, the more recent files, had this "off" hence getting a 1/3 MORE randoms
per calculation. (32,648*20=652,960 vs. 1e6 in total). 
So, this (should) explains the difference between e.g. the RR, xis_LS counts and values
in the k_output.dat files. 
Then, it definitely looks like the value of k_pi_para, it the pi_max cut, then explains
the differences for the files that had the same number of randoms, but e.g. different
values in the K_wp_sigma .dat files. 



OP_20080307 	    	has UNIFORM 0.70 < z < 1.40		(for cf. DEEP2) 


 OP_20080306 	has PRIMARY 0.30 < z < 2.90, 80<ra<280, i.e. NCG
			    	(but this mask is not the best it could be and has been superceeded)
 OP_20080315         again has a go using a first attempt of a PRIMARY data/random 
		    	        sample. Again, hasn't really worked, with large-scale issues.

 OP_20080427		has PRIMARY for 0.30<z<2.20, no ra,dec cuts. However, still doing
 			    	the randoms by "efficiency" so large-scale issues remain.
 OP_20080504		The first attempt to do PRIMARY with uniform randoms. However, 
 			    	 there was an mrfits .fits issue, screwing up the .dat randoms file.
 OP_20080506 	Was the NCG analogue of 20080504, with the same issues as above.
 		    	    	(One could put the 20080506 files into 20080504 to limit # dirs...)
 OP_20080507	    	Was a second attempt to get the PRIMARY sample with a 'uniform' 
 			      	random distribution. This worked okay, but (small) issues still 
				remain with  the RRs. e.g. the ang. mask  didn't look spot-on 
				(stripes widening  at lambda -> +/- 90degs etc.), 
				so went back and re-did that too.
OP_20080510		Had these issues with the angular mask, better N(z) taken care of, 
			    	but really didn't make *that* much difference at all...

OP_20080516		Was the essentially the same as 20080510, but with the ~93deg^2
			        of ``empty sectors'' having 0.5 and 0.0 completenesses.
				This directory now also has the "BadFields" files, where we excluded
				~14,000 fields  (~10,000 or 370 deg^2) over the spectroscopic 
				footprint. Made *very* little difference. 

OP_20080811		PRIMARY. Split the sample up into EDR/DR1 vs. DR2345 to
				see if this had been the cause of the PRI upturn at large scales. 
				It wasn't. And moreso, the total PRI sample (ie the "average"
				of EDR/DR1 and DR2345, seemed to be lower than either or the
				sub-samples. (Note also though that the EDR/DR1s are higher
				than both the DR2345 and the full PRIMARYs.)




*OP_20080508 	Has the UNIFORM sample, 0.30<z<2.20, for the full survey, the NCG
		    		and the SGC. 
				This directory, OP_20080508, also has the UNI22_picut22 and
				UNI22_picut18 files in it.  
				 
OP_UNI22_jack_radecz		 has the 21 (20N, 1S) jackknife subsamples for the ra,dec,z points used 
OP_UNI22_jack_zvalues		 has the 21 (20N, 1S) jackknife subsamples for the N(z)'s
*OP_UNI22_jack_xis		 has the 21 (20N, 1S) jackknife subsamples for the xi(s)
OP_UNI22_jack_xi_sigma_pi	 has the 21 (20N, 1S) jackknife subsamples for the 2D xi(sigma,pi)
OP_UNI22_jack_wp		 	 has the 21 (20N, 1S) jackknife subsamples for the wp(sigma)


UNI22_evol_5logbins_xis	 		 has the 10 (i.e. incl. 2.2<z<2.9) files for the xi(s)
UNI22_evol_5logbins_xi_sigma_pi	 	 has the 10 (i.e. incl. 2.2<z<2.9) files for the 2D xi(sigma,pi)
UNI22_evol_5logbins_wp	 		 has the 10 (i.e. incl. 2.2<z<2.9) files for the xi(s)


*OP_UNI22_EBV   			 has the UNI22 data for the two ~15,000 strong UNIFORM d
					        data files split by (dust) reddening using the 
						Schlegel et al. (1998) maps. The data and random where 
						split using dr5q_Ebv.pro and other code in the
						../data/Quasars/Schlegel_dust_maps/CodeIDL directory.
				Files used:
				../data/DR5QSO_uni_data_EBV_le_0pnt0217.dat	 
				../randoms/randoms_dat/randoms_npr_UNIFORM_EBV_le_0pnt0217.dat'
				../data/DR5QSO_uni_data_EBV_gt_0pnt0217.dat
				../randoms/randoms_dat/randoms_npr_UNIFORM_EBV_gt_0pnt0217.dat



OP_UNI22_wFibre			The 'regular' "wFibre" files are those using the UNIFORM DR5Qs 
				    	      	to work out collisions and the photo-z catalogues to assign 
						missing redshifts. 

						wFibre_v2 is the same again, but with the missing redshifts being
						assigned from the quasar redshift that "knocked out" the collided 
						object (a la DHWs suggestion).
