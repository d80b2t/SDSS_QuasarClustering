Eeeek. 
Have a bad feeling I actually over-wrote these O/P files, leaving only
the xi(sigma,pi) plots with different binnings. 

However, I'm pretty sure these 
a) had their randoms slightly wrong (either the redshift cuts weren't right, or 
   *something* was up...) and 
b) I was only using DD/DR estimators.
