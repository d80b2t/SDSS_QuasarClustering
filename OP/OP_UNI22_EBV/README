Has the 2PCF estimates of the UNI22 sample, but split on the sky
by reddening i.e. E(B-V) value from Schlegel et al. (1998).


!!!!!!!  NOTE   !!!!!
The two smallest scales of:
K_wp_output_UNI22_EBVle0pnt0217.dat
ie.  (s, log_s)=(0.31622776 -0.5)  and  (s, log_s)=  0.5011872 -0.3
have been copied from K_wp_output_UNI22_EBVgt0pnt0217.dat
in order to get the jackknife errors to "line up" properly. 

Shouldn't really be an issue when plotting so long as you plot
the gt0pnt2s OVER the lt0pnt2 data.
