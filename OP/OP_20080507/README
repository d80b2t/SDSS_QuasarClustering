These files *20080507* were the second attempt to get the 2PCF 
using a nice and uniformly distributed random catalouge: 

randoms_npr_PRIMARY_20080502v2.dat
and 
DR5QSO_pri_data_20080502.dat 
cutting at 0.30<z<2.2. 

This had the mrdfits issue (in q_z_bin_v1_04.pro) fixed. 

The original (ra,dec) (eta,lambda) file remains:
/Volumes/Bulk/npr/cos_pc19a_npr/data/Quasars/CAS/mask/ra_dec_eta_lambda_randoms_20080502

NB: ra_dec_eta_lambda_randoms_20080502.dat give both 
    randoms_npr_PRIMARY_20080502.dat and 
    randoms_npr_PRIMARY_20080502v2.dat but 
    the mrdfits issues caused randoms_npr_PRIMARY_20080502.dat to not reproduce the ra,dec distrib.


Although much closer to the e.g. 2QZ, result, 
there are still issues at large (>10 h^-1 Mpc,  but particularly >50 h^-1 Mpc) scales,
most of which I'm becoming particulary convinced is due to some issues in the Southern
Stripes. This is supported by looking at the OP from the South only (5661 datas, 135230 randoms, noting that even here you have 5660/4438=12.76% of the data and 13.5% of
the randoms, which might be an issue....) which has the upturn seen in the eg. 200804* 
data. 

Well, not so fast. 
Some of this maybe due to the South stripes but not all by any means - 
the North just dominates the numbers. Another couple of possibilties are
that the angular mask is still not quite right (which it isn't) and I think I
was normalising the random N(z) by an old number in q_z_bin_v1_05.pro: 
 
if choice eq 'P' then norm=1644. ;for z_max=2.9 
vs. 
if choice eq 'P' then norm=1500. ;for z_max=2.2

which doens't look like a huge difference but gives a much nicer fit
to the 0.30<z<2.2. 

This was adopted in:
open(1,file='../data/DR5QSO_pri_data_20080508.dat') 
[which is identical to DR5QSO_pri_data_20080502.dat 
and
open(2,file='../randoms/randoms_npr_PRIMARY_20080508.dat')
and is running now...
