Hi Nic,
        sorry for the delay in replying to you.  I put it down to the combined effects of a new baby and grant writing!  Anway...

There is a file attached which contains all these.  The README file lists which files are which (I've just sent you the ones you
requested).  The only one which may not be obvious is the 6QZ one, which is for fig. 26a. I'm also not 100% sure that the version I've sent
you of the data for fig. 26 is the right one (probably is).

Cheers,

Scott
