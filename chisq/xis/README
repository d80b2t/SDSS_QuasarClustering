General news
-----------
My old, but recently updated FORTRAN program:
   s0_gamma_from_xis_DR5Q.*
takes the measured xi(s) values, fits a Single Power-law mode over a given range of
s0s, gammas and s_maxs, and produces a file titled: 
     k_output_DR5Q_chisq_1.dat.
 
This has the chi^2 values and also the delta chi^2s need by
     contour_s0_gamma_DR5Q.pro 
or inded 
   contour_s0_gamma_DR5Q_3by3.pro
to plot the s0/gamma confidence levels a la joint 2-param fittings (Press et al. 1992 
FORTRAN receipes book). 
	fit_s0_gamma_rv1.ps
is the resulting plot. 


Latest I/P Version:
---------------
The latest version of the data files we are using is found in:
/Volumes/Bulk/npr/cos_pc19a_npr/programs/quasars/OP/UNI22_evol_10logbins_xis/ 

I tried going to both s_max=20 and s_max=25h^1 Mpc. 
There was some, but only really a little, change in the s0 values for all the sub-samples
except the 2.02<z<2.20, where only the s=25 limit made any sense. 

There was a sizeable difference in the gamma values, but these were generally all
over the place anyway from sub-sample to sub-sample (a la Croom05). 



Old I/P Version:
------------
The files in the 20080718 directory were made using the (slightly) out-dated files:
../OP/OP_20080121/k_output_20080121_0pnt30z0pnt68.dat
../OP/OP_20080122b/k_output_20080122_0pnt68z0pnt92.dat
../OP/OP_20080123/k_output_20080123_0pnt92z1pnt13.dat
../OP/OP_20080124/k_output_20080124_1pnt13z1pnt32.dat
../OP/OP_20080215/k_output_20080215_1pnt32z1pnt50.dat
../OP/OP_20080215b/k_output_20080215_1pnt50z1pnt66.dat
../OP/OP_20080215c/k_output_20080215_1pnt66z1pnt83.dat
 ../OP/OP_20080215d/k_output_20080215_1pnt83z2pnt02.dat
../OP/OP_20080215e/k_output_20080215_2pnt02z2pnt25.dat
../OP/OP_20080122/k_output_20080122_2pnt25z2pnt90.dat')
and the 
    s0_gamma_from_xis_DR5Q_20080718.f90
code (which is now in ../programs/quasars/old_f90/).
with the upper limit at 
     s=25.0 h^-1 Mpc.
