xis/ 
is (kinda obviously) for the redshift-space correlation functions. 
Usually fitting a single power-law over 25 h^1 Mpc (which gives an acceptable fit) or
100 h^1 Mpc (which doesn't give an acceptabla fit expect for the high-z subsamples). 

wpsigma/
is  (kinda obviously) for the projected correlation function, w_{p}(\sigma). 
but copies a lot of the code from xis/
