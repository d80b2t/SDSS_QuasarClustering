README file for quasars/chisq/wpsigma_div_sigma 
-----------------------------------------

In this directory there are files for taking the wp(rp)/rp
data and fitting (single) power-laws in order to find r0/gamma
for the e.g. redshift subsample slices. 

Note, there are two files. 

r0_from_wpsigma_div_sigma_DR5Q
basically holds gamma=2.0 fixed. 

where as r0_gamma_from_wpsigma_div_sigma_DR5Q
varies r0 and gamma (and as such calculates values
for "A(gamma)" on the fly. 


Running delta_chisq.pro  is a quick way to pick out
the r0 value which has the minimum chi^2 and the associated
(1 sigma) error.
