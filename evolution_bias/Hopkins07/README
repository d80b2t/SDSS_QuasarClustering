Hi Nic,

 Thanks for the email, glad to he a help. Took me a bit to dig into my old routines and find what you needed, but I think I've got it. Attached
are three files, corresponding to the three panels in Fig. 13 of Hopkins et al. (2007). Each one is a different (relatively simple toy) model for
the clustering evolution. The one labeled "default" corresponds to the middle panel of the figure ('QSOs Grow Uniformly...'), and what I think is
most likely (the models of fueling from a more a priori standpoint tend to agree with it best). But theres also 'extreme_feedback' corresponding
to the left panel of that Fig. 13 and 'maximal' corresponding to the right panel (all described in the paper, but let me know if youve got
specific questions). For each file, there are five columns:
(1) redshift
(2) bias of a 'typical' L* quasar, for the given model (since, in the model, the clustering does not depend strongly on quasar L below L*, this
is also equivalent to calculating the bias of an effectively infinitely deep sample)
(3) bias for the same sample, but with a magnitude-limited sample limited at i=22.0 (described in the text of the paper: we consider a sample
limited by a given apparent i-band magnitude).
(4) as column (3), but for a magnitude limit i=20.2
(5) as column (3), but for a magnitude limit i=19.0

The magnitude-limited cases rapidly start to run to extreme bias at high z, b/c in such a sample you would only see the most luminous quasars
corresponding to the most massive halos. Now, in practice, once the bias values get very large at these redshifts (b>~10, roughly), they are
*extremely* sensitive to the exact halo masses -- so don't take the exact bias predicted too literally (a very small change in the median or
scatter in halo mass-qso luminosity can affect them by a lot.. but regardless, the bias will still be very large).

Hope that helps, I'm definitely interested in seeing what you come up with as it develops.
