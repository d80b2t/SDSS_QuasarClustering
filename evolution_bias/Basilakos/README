Dear Nick,

I had a look on the M=1e+13 bias evolution and I realize that
I've sent you a wrong file. Here are the predictions of my models up to z=7:

-------------Interaction + no Interaction------------------
Mass=1e+12 C1=1.504 c2=-0.147 A=0.002 \nu=2.56
Mass=7e+12 C1=2.914 c2=-0.274 A=0.002 \nu=2.56
Mass=1e+13 c1=3.290 c2=-0.360 A=0.002 \nu=2.56 (THE CORRECT FILE)
-------------------------------------------------------------

As we point out in our paper for those halos with M>6e+13 the interactive
term fit well the simulated data (see fig.1 in our work).

Mass=7e+13 c1=6.376 c2=-0.573
Mass=1e+14 c1=7.198 c2=-0.752

Finally, I would like also to stress that our model is powerful in a sense that giving the measured bias evolution you can have an estimate
of the parent dark matter halo.
Notice, that I definitely trust my models within z\le 5
since in our paper we used 10 different redshift LCDM snapshots,
spanning the range 0\le z \le 5. Of course I believe that the models
should perform well also for z>5 but this is something that we have to check with the data.

If you need anything else let me know
I think that now the corrected Mass=1e+13 should match with the bias
evolution of optical QSOs.

best regards
spyros

Dear Nick,

Finally, I've managed to find some time in order to finish with the bias
issue and here are the details:

------------------Cosmology Om=0.27 s8=0.9-----------------------

(a) bias.mass1e+12 Mass=1e+12 C1=1.504 C2=-0.147  (from eq. 24) A=0.002
\nu=2.56
(b) bias.mass1e+13 Mass=1e+13 c1=3.290 c2=-0.307 A=0.005 \nu=2.62

Now, (i) first column=z (bin=0.2)
(ii) second column=b(z) including the interactive term
(iii) third column=b(z) without the interactive term
(iv) last column is the difference between (ii)-(iii)

As you can see the interaction among the halos starts to affect the bias
evolution at relatively large redshifts (z>2), which is expected within
the framework of the LCDM model.

(c) bias.mass1e+14: Mass=1e+14  C1=7.198 C2=-0.642

(i) first column =z
(ii) column = b(z)
Note that at those scales we find that the interactive does not
affect really the bias evolution (see the discussion
in our paper - section 3.2)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm looking forward to see the comparison (data+models).

If you need anything else let me know.

best regards
Spyros
