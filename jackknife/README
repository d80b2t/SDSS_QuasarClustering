jackknife_DR5Q_UNI22_xis.pro
is the IDL program that calculates the (xi(s)) jackknifes. 




Note.
../OP/OP_20080508/k_output_UNI22_N.dat
and
../OP/OP_UNI22_jack_xis/k_output_UNI22_jack_S.dat
are the same file with the top file having the naming
convention since it was using the North data from the 
UNI22 sample, while the bottom files have its name 
from the fact it is the jackknife excluding the South
region. 


Using  e.g. Myers et al., 2007 (ApJ, 658, 85), equation A2.
