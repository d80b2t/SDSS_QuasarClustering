jackknife_DR5Q_UNI22_xis.pro
is the IDL program that calculates the (xi(s)) jackknifes. 




Note.
../OP/OP_20080508/k_output_UNI22_N.dat
and
../OP/OP_UNI22_jack_xis/k_output_UNI22_jack_S.dat
are the same file with the top file having the naming
convention since it was using the North data from the 
UNI22 sample, while the bottom files have its name 
from the fact it is the jackknife excluding the South
region.

Hi Nic,

Good to hear from you....

Don't forget Myers et al. 2006, 638, 622
(http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2006ApJ...638..622M). I
bring this up because I'm egotistical and like to remind people that I
perfomred the first quasar clustering analysis in the SDSS.

Both are technically correct.....  the former is referring to an
average over random realizations (i.e. the variant is the  background
random distribution) and therefore the mean is over the realizations.
The latter is an average over different areas of the sky (i.e. the
variant is the data  distribution) and thus the average is over the
entire sky (i.e. the CF for the whole  dataset). Thus, as I suspect
you're using data as the variant,  Myers et al. 2007 (ApJ, 658, 85),
equation A2 (which technically first appeared in the literature in
Myers et al. 2005, 359, 741,
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?2005MNRAS.359..741,
equation 5),  is the correct equation.

Nothing to do with the "mean" versus "whole". Something else entirely.
The inclusion of the RR_L/RR terms introduces an extra (N-1)/N, so you
don't  need one out front. Easiest way to picture this is to look at
Scranton et al., 2002, ApJ, 579, 48
(http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...579...48S) equation 10 for
the *unweighted* jackknife

error**2  = (N-1)/N sum (w_L -w)**2

and compare to my equation for the weighted jackknife

error**2  = sum (RR_L/RR)*(w_L -w)**2

The difference between Scranton's equation and my equation arises
because Scranton  divided the sky into N areas of equal fractional
weight N-1 (in other words, say you divide the sky into 5 areas....in
each jackknife realization you will consider the  data in the other
four areas and thus RR_L/RR = 0.8 = 4/5). Thus in the unweighted
jackknife, each instance of RR_L/RR carries an equal weight of (N-1)/N
and you can take the term outside of the summation.  (Note that the
real reason that the N-1 term is there in Scranton's equation in the
first place is because w_L has a higher variance than w).

The point of my weighted jackknife is that RR_L/RR do not carry equal
weight (and should not, because of, e.g., the survey geometry) and
hence you can't take the (N-1)/N outside of the summation. It's
implicit in the RR_L/RR terms though. You can see that by, say,
assuming that you divide the sky into three areas, one that ends up
containing 80% of the data and two that end up containing 10% each of
the data, then the weights of the terms would be

error**2  = sum (RR_L/RR)*(w_L -w)**2 = [(1-0.1)/3]*(w_L -w)**2 +
[(1-0.1)/3]*(w_L -w)**2 + [(1-0.8)/3]*(w_L -w)**2 = (0.9/3)*(w_L
-w)**2 + (0.9/3)*(w_L -w)**2 + (0.2/3)*(w_L -w)**2.

If w_L-w were equal in all cases. This would be
2/3(w_L-w)**2. (i.e. (N-1)/N out front)

Yeah, I think Jose got this wrong initially in his last paper until I
corrected him. Tom's usually very, very sharp on statistics though, so
I'd be surprised if he wasn't right practically 100% of the time.

My code's written in Python using biggles
(http://biggles.sourceforge.net/). If you're willing to install
biggles (I assume you have Python). I'm happy to send you my
code. It's pretty neat....you can play around with funky color schemes
very easily. Anyway, it's yours if you want it.

Technically I'm external to SDSS (which has been a right pain) so I
probably won't be at the meeting (I work about 3 hours south of
Chicago). If I'm there we can definitely meet up, though.

Sure, I'd absolutely be up for this Aug 3rd. Don't know if it's easy
for you logistically, though. I don't have accommodation in Chicago,
like I said, so a night of hotel would probably be involved, unless
you drove and went via my place (which is an extra 3 hours on a 9 hour
drive!). But we could definitely arrange something, I would think.

I was never worried about the drop! I think I said as much. Emre
hardly played last season, and N'Zogbia and Milner would be my first
pick "creative midfielders" anyway. So, not too sad there. If we sell
Milner or Zog I'll be pissed off though....most footie teams need at
least one player in midfield to be successful.

No problem, I'm always happy to help out. Plus I always use you on my
