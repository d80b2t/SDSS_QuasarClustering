README file for
/Volumes/Bulk/npr/cos_pc19a_npr/programs/quasars/randoms/

Files with randoms on and before 20 Jan 2008, are for the UNIFORM, (Shen et al., 2007)
33,000 object strong sample.

These have either `UNIFORM' or 'Shen' in their name (unsurprisingly).


The other random_npr.dat files are based on the PRIMARY DR5Q sample that
I've been labouring to make in 
/Volumes/Bulk/npr/cos_pc19a_npr/data/Quasars/CAS/mask/


../data/DR5QSO_pri_data.dat 
has 50 062 lines, i.e. is the PRIMARY sample, with z<=2.90. 
Recall that the full PRIMARY sample has 55 577 objects (cf. 77 429 for the full DR5Q).
