OK, so to be a uniformly-select quasar, it must be targeted as one of
the five main  quasar targets described in Richards et al. (2002, AJ,
123, 2945); and it must also be targeted using target version V3_1_0
or later (because the algorithm in Richards et al. was only
implemented after DR1; my angular mask has taken care of that
detail). Quasars that were targeted with QSO_HIZ only (one of the five
main QSO targets) are targeted to i fainter than 19.1 at z<2.9, so I
have removed those objects to make sure that at z<2.9 the sample is
flux limited to i=19.1 (you may find some discussions on this in
Fig. 17 of Richards et al. 2006, AJ, 131, 2766 for the LF paper). The
number of these objects that are fainter than i=19.1 at z<2.9 is tiny
compared with the whole clustering sample.

Imposing these criterion to the 77,429 objects in the catalog you cut
it down to 38,208 objects.

This 13.1% is another detail, which we further exclude quasars
selected in those "BAD" imaging fields (a "field" is a basic SDSS
imaging run unit of the size 10'x13') in our highz clustering
sample. And a field is identified as "BAD" according to the criterions
outlined in sec. 2.2 of our highz qso clustering paper. Since we found
it didn't make a big difference, we don't need to consider this detail
for our current purposes (plus, this additional cut will reduce the
number of quasars again).

I am sorry that the SDSS survey is a little bit complicated because of
the large volumn. But I guess we will have to live on with it:-)

Yes, the reason that the random points only have ra and dec is because
there are different ways to assign random redshifts. You can either
assign random redshifts by fitting a smooth function to the uniform
DR5 N(z) distribution, or in my case, I would bin N(z) at a grid of
dz=0.05 for example, and assign random redshifts according to the
binned distribution. I, and other people, found it didn't make a big
difference when you use different ways to assign random redshifts, as
long as the random redshifts more or less trace the real N(z)
distribution. The random sample is totally random, so you don't need
to worry about the order. I suggest you do the smoothed function
thing, and I will do the binned distribution thing, and we can compare
our results with each other (I guess it won't be very different, but
we'd better make sure of that).

For the spherematch, yes, it searches for pairs with certain angular
separation, and then you convert the angular separation into physical
separation using redshift info. Good thing about spherematch is it is
implemented in IDL (but it is writted in C) and is easy to use.

I hope my answers are helpful. Some related discussions on the
selection of a uniform quasar sample can be found in Richards et al.
(2006, AJ, 131, 2766) for the SDSS quasar luminosity function paper.


Cheers, Yue
