Subject: uniform DR5 quasar/random catalogs


Dear Nic,

I have generated the data/random catalogs. Please download 
http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~yshen/DR5_QSO_clustering/DR5QSO_uni_data.fits.tar.gz  for the quasar sample and 
http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~yshen/DR5_QSO_clustering/DR5QSO_uni_random_RADEC.fits.tar.gz  for the random sample.

The data sample is ready for CF measurements, which only contains 
uniformly-selected SDSS quasars, which is flux limited to dereddened 
i=19.1 at z<2.9, and flux limited to i=20.2 at z>~2.9. The random sample 
contains 1,000,000 random (RA,DEC) points according to the angular 
geometry of the data sample (you don't need to use them all of course).

The data/random format is an IDL structure, so you can read them in using 
"mrdfits" in IDL Goddard Utilities:

IDL> data = mrdfits('DR5QSO_uni_data.fits', 1)
IDL> random = mrdfits('DR5QSO_uni_random_RADEC.fits', 1)

The "data" struct contains a lot of tags, but you only need data.ra, 
data.dec and data.z, which are the ra, dec, redshift for SDSS quasars. The 
"random" struct contains two tags, namely, random.ra and random.dec.

You may want to avoid the dip in the quasar redshift distribution around 
z=2.7 caused by selection inefficiency. I think it should be safe if you 
cut the quasar sample at z<2.5 (which cut I am using to do the 
luminosity-dependence of clustering at lowz).

OK, that's it. Let me know if anything is not clear. I am measuring the 
redshift space CF for the sample too, so it is good to check with your 
measurements to make sure everything is consistent. If any problem comes 
along, just drop me an email. Thanks!
