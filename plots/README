README file from quasars/plots
---------------------------

Here is the (IDL) code for making the plots for the SDSS DR5 Quasar
correlation function work. 

The plots directory itself is split up in
xis           - for the redshift-space correlation function (including the evolution "3x4" grid)
xi_sp        - for the `2D' correlation function, xi(rp, pi)
wp_sigma - for wp(rp) and thus incorrectly named with "sigma" as the across-the-line-of-sight variable
wp_sigma_div_sigma - wp(rp)/rp plots including the 3x4 evolution grid.
