wp_sigma_div_sigma_DR5_quasars_3by4_for_evol_20090213
has the errors from both the Poisson:Jackknife "geometric mean" method
i.e. x5 at rp<10 h^ Mpc and x45 at rp >h^-1 Mpc
as dashed, green lines. 
The variable in the .pro file is e.g. "error2_div_sigma_0pnt30z0pnt68". 


wp_sigma_div_sigma_DR5_quasars_3by4_for_evol_20090220.pdf
has the original wp(rp) points, and the scaled  Poisson:Jackknife errors 
using the information from all scaling scales (!, given by black filled
circles, solid black lines). 
Also has points from getting wp(rp) with the LS estimator but including
bins with no DD pairs (but that have values since there are DR and RR pairs). 
Then, the "summed variance" Poisson error estimates are also shown, BUT
using the "regular w/DD" data points. These are the green, dashed points and lines.

has the original wp(rp) points, and the scaled  Poisson:Jackknife errors 
using the information from all scaling scales (!, given by black filled
circles, solid black lines). 
Also has points from getting wp(rp) with the LS estimator but now not including
bins with no DD pairs (just like the "original" estimates)  
Then, the "summed variance" Poisson error estimates are also shown, AND
using the "regular w/DD" data points. These are the green, dashed points and lines.


wp_sigma_div_sigma_DR5_quasars_3by4_for_evol_20090225.pdf
has the 'regular' points, with the scaled errorbars and the corresponding
power-law fit (keeping gamma=-2). 


wp_sigma_div_sigma_DR5_quasars_3by4_for_evol_20090225v2.pdf
has the 'regular' points, now with the "summed variances" errorbars
and the corresponding, power-law fits (again, gamma held at -2).
