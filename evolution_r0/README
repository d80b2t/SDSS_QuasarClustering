/Volumes/Bulk/npr/cos_pc19a_npr/programs/quasars/evolution_r0 > 


The values of the r0s with the redshift-evolution come
from the program:
r0_gamma_from_wpsigma.pro
in the ../programs/quasars directory. 

Note, here we set the power-law to a fixed value (current gamma=1.8d) and
then invert the wp(sigma) values on a point-by-point basis to find
the value of r0 which would correspond *and* the error (by doing a V. simple
error on the mean.)
