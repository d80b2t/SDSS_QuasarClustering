Welcome!

Here we give some more of the background material, including data catalogues, source code and high-resolution figures
for Ross et al. (2009, ApJ accepted, arXiv:0903:3230v1).
This is the first in a series of two papers investigating the clustering properties of the SDSS Quasars using the Data Release 5 catalogue.
Our sister paper is Shen et al. (2009, ApJ accepted, arXiv:0810.4144v2).

This site is an "ongoing project", should not be consider a complete or comprehensive resource at this point, and will be subject to updates in due course.
However, please feel free to email me if you have any specific questions or requests.

Thanks,
Nic

SDSS DR5 Quasar data and randoms
----------------------------------
In /data

Use of the SDSS DR5 Quasar catalogue requires reference to Schneider et al., 2007, AJ, 134, 102.
Use of the SDSS DR5 Quasar UNIFORM sample (including using the bolometric luminosity or virial BH mass information) requires reference to Shen et al. 2008, ApJ, 680, 169.

Data
----
dr5qso.fits is the full, 77,429 object strong DR5 Quasar Catalogue from Schneider et al., 2007.

DR5QSO_uni_data.fits, is the 'UNIFORM' quasar sample. The criteria for this sample originate in Richards et al. 2006, AJ, 131, 2766 and also in Shen et al., 2007,  AJ, 133, 2222.
The UNIFORM sample itself was used in Shen et al. (2009). 

For ease, the data file that is read into the FORTRAN 2 Point Correlation Function code is: 
DR5QSO_uni_data.dat

DR5QSO_uni_data_wFibre.dat
and 
DR5QSO_uni_data_wFibre_v2.dat
are the two data files that are used to check for the effects of fibre collisions in Appendix C.

Randoms
---------
The necessary random catalogue files are:
randoms_npr_UNIFORM.dat

with
randoms_npr_UNIFORM_EBV_gt_0pnt0217.dat
and
randoms_npr_UNIFORM_EBV_le_0pnt0217.dat 
needed for the Reddening checks (Appendix C.5). 



------------------------------------
FORTRAN 2 Point Correlation Function code
------------------------------------
In /src directory. 

This code is fairly well commented but a bit "clunky"
Needs two input files, the data and the random catalogues from above.

This is the main program that takes SDSS Quasar data (DR5) and computes:
- the redshift-space correlation function, xi(s),
- the ``2-D'' correlation function, xi(sigma,pi)
- the projected correlation function, wp(rp).



-------------
IDL Scripts
-------------
In the /pro directory.
Note, only the 'main' generated output files are currently here.

xi(s)
------
In  /pro/xis
k_output_UNI22.dat (6.6k)is the xi(s) measurement for the complete UNIFORM sample.
While k_output_UNI22_XpntXXzYpntYY_10log.dat (~5k) are the redshift slice files over X.XX < z < Y.YY.
The columns for these files are:
s_log, s, xi(s)_std, delta_xis (Poisson), DD pair counts, DR pair counts, RR pair counts, xi(s)_LS, xi(s)_HAM, ratio (which is not relevant).
The format is:
f5.2, 1x, f15.6, 1x, f15.8, 1x, f18.13, 1x, f18.0, 1x, f18.0, 1x, f18.0, 1x, f18.10, 1x, f18.10, 1x, f21.5.
k_output_UNI22_jackknife_errors.dat has the jackknife errors. 

The columns for these files are: 
 s_log, s, xi(s)_std, delta_xis (Poisson), DD pair counts, DR pair counts, RR pair counts, xi(s)_LS, xi(s)_HAM, ratio (which is not relevant). 
The format is:  
f5.2, 1x, f15.6, 1x, f15.8, 1x, f18.13, 1x, f18.0, 1x, f18.0, 1x, f18.0, 1x, f18.10, 1x, f18.10, 1x, f21.5.  

The 2QZ data was kindly supplied by S.M. Croom.
Any use of this data requires citation of Croom et al., 2005, MNRAS, 356, 415).

Any use of the results from the 2SLAQ QSO Survey requires citation of da Angela et al., 2008, MNRAS, 383, 565). 


wp(rp)
--------
In /pro/wp_div_rp

K_wp_output_UNI22.dat (1.4k)is the wp(rp) measurement for the complete UNIFORM sample.

K_wp_output_UNI22_jackknife_errors.dat are the wp(rp) jackknife errors.

K_wp_output_UNI22_30rnds_picut25.dat
K_wp_output_UNI22_20rnds_picut39.dat
K_wp_output_UNI22_30rnds_picut100.dat
are the wp(rp) values for the full UNIFORM sample with a pi_max cut of 
25, 39 and 100 h^-1 Mpc respectively. 

K_wp_output_UNI22_wFibre.dat
K_wp_output_UNI22_wFibre_v2.dat
have the checks for wp(rp) and fibre collisions (i.e. Fig 25).


Linear bias evolution
--------------------------
In /pro/evolution/bias

Need to call "RED", a set of cosmology routines written in IDL by L. and J. Moustakas. 
Please see:
http://cerebus.as.arizona.edu/~ioannis/research/red/ 
for details. 

All the files should be fairly self explanatory. 
Note many other peoples work is used here. Please cite appropriately!!

Tables
-------
In the /tables directory.
These are straight cut and pastes from the main .tex file.
